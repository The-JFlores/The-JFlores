## 👋 Hello! I'm The-JFlores

I'm a passionate developer exploring the intersection between **AI, privacy**, and **open-source innovation**.  
I enjoy building tools that empower users — like my latest project: [Lucy](https://github.com/The-JFlores/July4_Assignment_3), a privacy-first voice assistant that runs completely offline.
